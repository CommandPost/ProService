# ProService Framework

This repository has been thrown together as a source of unofficial documentation for Apple's ProService Framework, which powers the "Workflow Extensions" functionality that was introduced as part of Final Cut Pro X 10.4.4.

Currently the ProService Framework is private, and the only applications that have access to this API are:

* [Frame.io](https://frame.io/fcpx)
* [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/fcpx)

At the release of Final Cut Pro 10.4.4 there has been no mention from Apple as to whether the API will be made public, or whether third parties will have access to this Framework, so we decided to do some digging ourselves.

You can view the ProService Headers [here](https://github.com/CommandPost/ProService/tree/master/Headers).

In the not-too-distant-future, we hope to add an Xcode Project example allowing you to test out the Framework, and build your own Workflow Extension.

Enjoy!
